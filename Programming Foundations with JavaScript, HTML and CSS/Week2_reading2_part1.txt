Write a JavaScript program that modifies an image by putting three vertical stripes on it - a red stripe on the left one third, a green stripe in the middle, and a blue stripe on the right one third. For example, if your program ran on Drew’s picture shown on the left, the resulting image would have red, green and blue vertical stripes as shown in the image on the right.


The red stripe is made by changing the red component of all the pixels in the left vertical third to 255, while leaving the green and blue components as their values in the original image. The green and blue stripes are made similarly, but instead of modifying the red component of each pixel in the correct part of the image you will modify the green or blue component. 

Let’s consider what steps your program will need to take in order to modify this image.

1. Start with the image you want to change. 

2. Figure out the width of the image. 

3. For each pixel in the image:

Get the x-coordinate for that pixel
If the pixel’s x-coordinate is less than one-third of the image’s width, set the pixel’s red value to 255.
If the pixel’s x-coordinate is between one-third and two-thirds of the image’s width, set the pixel’s green value to 255.
If the pixel’s x-coordinate is more than two-thirds of the image’s width, set the pixel’s blue value to 255.
4. Print the image.

// write your code here
var img = new SimpleImage("hilton.jpg");
print(img);
var x = img.getWidth();
for (var pix of img.values()){
    if(pix.getX() < x/3){
        pix.setRed(255);
    }
    else if(pix.getX()>= x/3 && pix.getX() < 2*x/3){
        pix.setGreen(255);
    }
    else{
        pix.setBlue(255);
    }
}
print(img)
